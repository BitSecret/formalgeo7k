  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, after the Malaysian Airlines N_0 lost contact, the \"Marine Cruiser N_1\" ship was searching and rescuing in the Indian Ocean at a constant speed. When it reached point A, it found a lighthouse B in the east N_2 direction of the north, and the maritime cruise ship continued to sail north for N_3 hours. Arriving at point C, lighthouse B is found in the N_4 direction of its north-east. If the cruise ship continues to sail north, how long will the cruise ship be closest to lighthouse B? ()",
