  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the picture, Xiaoying of the mathematics interest group wants to measure the height of a tree in front of the teaching building. During the extracurricular activities in the afternoon, she measured the shadow length of a bamboo pole with a length of N_0 as N_1, but when she immediately measured the height of the tree , Found that not all the shadows of the trees fell on the ground, and some of the shadows fell on the walls of the teaching building (as shown in the picture). He first measured the height of the shadow left on the wall as N_2, and then measured the shadow length on the ground as N_3. Please help her calculate, the height of the tree is ()",

  "raw_answer": "解:如图,设BD是BC在地面的影子,树高为x,根据竹竿的高与其影子的比值和树高与其影子的比值相同得\\frac{CB}{BD}=\\frac{1}{0.8}而CB=1.2,∴BD=0.96,∴树在地面的实际影子长是0.96+2.6=3.56,再竹竿的高与其影子的比值和树高与其影子的比值相同得\\frac{x}{3.56}=\\frac{1}{0.8},∴x=4.45,∴树高是4.45m．故选:C．",
