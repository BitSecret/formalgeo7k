  "problem_text_en": "In order to measure the width of a small river, Xiaoming’s group decided to select a point on the opposite bank of the river as point A, and select three points B, C, and E on the same side of the bank, so that B, C, and E are on the same straight line, and AB Vertical to BE. After point E, make the extended line of DE ⊥ BE cross AC at point D, and measure BC = N_0, CE = N_1, DE = N_2, then the width of the river AB is approximately ()",
