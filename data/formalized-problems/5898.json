  "problem_text_cn": "我国纸伞的制作工艺十分巧妙．如图,伞不管是张开还是收拢,伞柄AP始终平分同一平面内两条伞骨所成的角∠BAC,且AE=AF,DE=DF,从而保证伞圈能沿着伞柄滑动．有一种玩具伞张开时,BDC在同一直线上,若AB=50cm,AD=14cm,则制作一把这样的纸伞需要油纸的面积是(不记接缝)()",
  "problem_text_en": "The production process of paper umbrellas in our country is very ingenious. As shown in the figure, whether the umbrella is opened or closed, the handle AP always bisects the angle ∠BAC formed by the two ribs in the same plane, and AE = AF, DE = DF, so as to ensure that the umbrella ring can slide along the handle. When a toy umbrella is opened, the BDC is on the same straight line. If AB = N_0, AD = N_1, then the area of ​​oil paper required to make such a paper umbrella is (don't remember the seam) ()",
