  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, there are two trees AB and CD side by side on the left and right. The height of the small tree is AB = N_0, and the height of the big tree is CD = N_1. Xiao Ming estimates that his eyes are above the ground EF = N_2, and he looks right when he stands at point F. Go to point C at the top of the tree. Knowing that the distance BF between him and the small tree at this time = N_3, then the distance BD between the two trees is ()",
