  "problem_text_en": "At N_0 in the morning, a ship departs from point A and sails in the direction due east at a speed of N_1 nautical miles per hour, and arrives at point B at N_2 and N_3 minutes. As shown in the figure, the island M is measured from A and B. In the direction of N_4 north by east and N_5 north by east, then the distance between B and island M is ()",
