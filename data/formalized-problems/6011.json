  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, in order to measure the degree of tree AB, a certain mathematics learning interest group measured the length of the tree's shadow BC in the sun as N_0. At the same moment, they also measured the shadow length of Xiaoliang in the sun as N_1. Knowing that Xiaoliang's height is N_2, then the height of tree AB is ()",
