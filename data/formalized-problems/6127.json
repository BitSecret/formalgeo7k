  "problem_text_en": "The figure is a schematic diagram of prying a rock with a lever. C is the fulcrum. When end A of the lever is pressed hard, the lever rotates around point C, and the other end B is tilted upwards, and the rock is pried. There is a rock. To make it roll, the B end of the lever must be tilted up by N_0. Knowing that the ratio of the lever's power arm AC to the resistance arm BC is N_1:N_2, the rock must be rolled, at least the lever A End down()",
