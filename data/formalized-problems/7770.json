  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, when planting trees on flat ground, the plant spacing (the horizontal distance between two adjacent trees) is required to be N_0. If trees are planted on a hillside with a slope of N_1:N_2, and the plant spacing is also required to be N_3, then the slope distance between two adjacent trees is ()",
