  "problem_text_en": "In an activity class, the two study groups A and B measured some objects in the campus at the same time under the sun. The following are some information they obtained through measurement: As shown in Figure 1, the shadow length of a bamboo pole standing on the flat ground with a length of N_0 is N_1 measured by Group A. As shown in Figure 2, the shadow length of the school flagpole measured by Group B is N_2. Then the length of the flagpole is ()",
