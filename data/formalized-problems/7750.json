  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, a certain ship sails from east to west. At A, it is measured that lighthouse M is in the direction of N_0 to its north by west, and it continues to sail for N_1 nautical miles to reach point B. At this time, it is measured that lighthouse M is in the direction of N_2 to its north by west. Then BM = ()",
