  "problem_text_en": "The picture is a schematic diagram of Xiao Ming designed a flashlight to measure the height of an ancient city wall. A horizontal plane mirror is placed at point P. The light starts from point A and is reflected by the plane mirror and just hits the top C of the ancient city wall CD. It is known that AB ⊥ BD, CD ⊥ BD, and the measured AB = N_0, BP = N_1, PD = N_2, then the height of the ancient city wall is ()",
