  "problem_text_cn": "数学兴趣小组的小明想测量教学楼前的一棵树的高度．下午课外活动时他测得一根长为1m的竹竿的影长是0.8m．但当他马上测量树高时,发现树的影子不全落在地面上,有一部分影子落在教学楼的墙壁上(如图)．他先测得留在墙壁上的树影高为1.2m,又测得地面的影长为2.6m,请你帮他算一下,下列哪个数字最接近树高()m．",
  "problem_text_en": "Xiao Ming of the Mathematics Interest Group wants to measure the height of a tree in front of the teaching building. During extracurricular activities in the afternoon, he measured the shadow length of a bamboo pole with a length of N_0 to be N_1. But when he immediately measured the height of the tree, he found that not all the shadow of the tree fell on the ground, and some of the shadow fell on the wall of the teaching building (pictured). He first measured the height of the tree shadow on the wall as N_2, and then measured the shadow length on the ground as N_3. Please help him to calculate which of the following numbers is closest to the height of the tree ().",
