  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, Xiaoming used a homemade right-angled triangular cardboard EFG to measure the height of the tree AB. He adjusted his position and tried to keep the hypotenuse EG horizontal, and the line where the side EF was located passed through point A. Given that the two legs of the cardboard EF = N_0, FG = N_1, the horizontal distance between Xiaogang and the tree is measured BD = N_2, the height of the edge EG from the ground DE = N_3, then the height of the tree AB is equal to ()",
