  "problem_text_cn": "汶川地震后,抢险队派一架直升飞机去A、B两个村庄抢险,飞机在距地面450米上空的P点,测得A村的俯角为30°,B村的俯角为60°(如图)则A,B两个村庄间的距离是()米．",
  "problem_text_en": "After the Wenchuan earthquake, the rescue team sent a helicopter to the two villages of A and B. The aircraft was at point P above the ground N_0. The measured depression angle of village A was N_1 and the depression angle of village B was N_2 (as shown in the figure). Then the distance between the two villages A and B is ().",
