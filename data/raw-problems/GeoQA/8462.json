  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, the height of a highway bridge from the ground AC is N_0, and the horizontal width BC of the approach bridge AB is N_1. In order to reduce the slope, it is decided to change the slope of the approach bridge to AD and make the slope N_2:N_3, then the length of BD is ()",
