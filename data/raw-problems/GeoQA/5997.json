  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the picture, Xiaoying designed a flashlight to measure the height of an ancient city wall. Place a horizontal plane mirror at point P. The light starts from point A and is reflected by the plane mirror and hits the top C of the ancient city wall CD. It is known that AB ⊥ BD, CD ⊥ BD. And it is measured that AB = N_0, BP = N_1, PD = N_2. Then the height of the ancient city wall CD is ()",
