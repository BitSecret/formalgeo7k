  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, in order to measure the height of an unreachable tree on the level of the campus, the school mathematics interest group did the following exploration: According to the law of light reflection in \"Science\", using a mirror and a measuring tape, design the measurement scheme as shown in the figure below: put a small mirror at point E away from the bottom of the tree (B) N_0, and then retreat along the straight line BE to point D. At this time, you can see the vertex A of the treetop in the mirror, and then use it. Measured with a measuring tape, DE = N_1, the height of the observer's eye CD = N_2, then the height of the tree (AB) is approximately ()",
