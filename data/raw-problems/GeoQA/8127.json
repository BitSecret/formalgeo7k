It is known that AD ∥ BC, and the distance between AD and BC is N_0, and the slope of the backwater slope CD is i = N_1:N_2. In order to improve the flood control capacity of the dam, it is necessary to strengthen the dam. After reinforcement, the top AE of the dam is wider than the original top AD by N_3, and the slope of the backwater slope EF is i = N_4:N_5, then the increased length CF at the bottom of the dam is ().", "problem_img": "8127.png", "construction_cdl": ["Polygon()", "Collinear()", "Cocircular()"], "text_cdl": [], "image_cdl": [], "goal_cdl": "", "problem_answer": "", "theorem_seqs": [], "raw_choices": ["7", "11", "13", "20"], "raw_answer": "解:过D作DG⊥BC于G,EH⊥BC于H,∴GH=DE=2,∵DG=EH=15,背水坡CD的坡度i=1:0.6,背水坡EF的坡度i=3:4,∴CG=9,HF=20,∴CF=GH+HF-CG=13米,故选:C．", "raw_label": 2, "raw_formal_point": ["直角三角形", "距离", "坡角", "三角函数"], "raw_comment": "本题考查了解直角三角形的应用,解答本题的关键是理解坡度、坡比的含义,构造直角三角形,利用三角函数表示相关线段的长度,难度一般．"}
