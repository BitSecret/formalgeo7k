  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, in order to measure the height of a tree, Xiao Ming uses a bamboo pole with a length of N_0 as a measuring tool, and moves the bamboo pole so that the top of the bamboo pole and the shadow of the top of the tree fall on the same point on the ground. At this time, the distance between the bamboo pole and this point is N_1 , And the distance from the tree is N_2, then the height of the tree is ()",
