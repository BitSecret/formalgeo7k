  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, the radius of the large observation car in the amusement park is N_0. It is known that the observation car is moving clockwise around the center O at a constant speed, and it takes N_1 minutes to make a revolution. Someone rides from the lowest point of the observation car (ground A). After N_2 minutes, what is the height of this person from the ground CD (the height from the lowest point of the viewing area to the ground is ignored) ()",
