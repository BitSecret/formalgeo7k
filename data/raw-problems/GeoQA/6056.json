  "problem_text_en": "The figure is a schematic diagram of a shadow (circle) formed on the ground after the light from the bulb (think as a point) directly above the round table illuminates the desktop. The diameter of the desktop is known to be N_0, and the distance from the desktop to the ground is N_1. If the bulb is N_2 from the ground, the area of ​​the shaded part on the ground is ()",
