  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, Xiao Ming, who is N_0 in height, wants to measure the height of the big tree on the side of the playground. He walks along the tree shadow BA from B to A. When he reaches point C, the top of his shadow coincides with the top of the tree's shadow. Measured BC = N_1, CA = N_2, so the height of the tree is ()",

  "raw_answer": "解:如图,∵BC=1.4m,CA=0.7m,∴AB=AC+BC=0.7+1.4=2.1(m),∵小明与大树都与地面垂直,∴△ACE∽△ABD,∴\\frac{CE}{BD}=\\frac{AC}{AB},即\\frac{1.6}{BD}=\\frac{0.7}{2.1},解得BD=4.8．故选:B．"
