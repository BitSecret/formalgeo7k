  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, after the Haiti earthquake, the rescue team sent a helicopter to the two villages of C and D. The plane was at point A above the ground N_0. The measured depression angle of D village was N_1, and the measured depression angle of C village was N_2. How far is the distance between the two villages of DC? ()",
