  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, there is a pond. To measure the distance between A and B at both ends of the pond, firstly take a point C on the flat ground that can directly reach points A and B without passing through the pond, connect AC and extend to D, so that CD = CA , Connect BC and extend to E, make CE = CB, connect ED. If DE = N_0 is measured, then the distance between A and B is ()",
