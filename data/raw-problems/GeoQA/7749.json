  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, a cargo ship sails from point A to point D in the east direction at a speed of N_0 nautical mile/hour. At point A, a certain island C is measured in the direction N_1 east by north. The cargo ship arrived at point B after sailing for N_2 minutes. At this time, it was measured that the island is in the direction N_3 east by north. Then the shortest distance between the cargo ship and the island C is ()",
