  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, in order to measure the slope of the slope protection rock dam (the ratio of the vertical height of the slope to the horizontal width is called the slope), a bamboo pole AC with a length of N_0 is leaned against the rock dam, and the pole length N_1 is measured. The height of point D from the ground DE = N_2, and the distance between the bottom of the pole and the dam foot AB = N_3, then the slope of the rock dam is ()",
