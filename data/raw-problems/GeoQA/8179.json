  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, the distance between a school A and the highway is N_0, and the distance from a station D on the edge of the highway is N_1. Now a store C is to be built on the edge of the highway so that it is equal to the distance between school A and station D. The distance between the store and the station is approximately ()",

  "raw_answer": "解:作AD的垂直平分线CE,作AF⊥CD,垂足为F．则AF=3000,AD=5000．根据勾股定理得DF=4000．∴cos∠D=\\frac{4000}{5000}=\\frac{4}{5}．在直角△CED中,cos∠D=\\frac{4000}{5000}=\\frac{4}{5}=\\frac{DE}{CD},∵AD=5000,∴DE=2500．∴\\frac{4}{5}=\\frac{2500}{CD}．解得CD=3125(米)．故选:B．"
