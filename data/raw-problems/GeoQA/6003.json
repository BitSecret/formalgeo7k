  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, two vertices A and B are located at the two ends of a pond. Xiaoming wants to use a rope to measure the distance between A and B, but the rope is not long enough, so he thought of a way. First, take one on the ground and reach point A directly. Connect to point O of point B, connect AO and extend to C, make OC = {N_0}{N_1} AO, connect BO and extend to D, make OD = \\frac{N_2}{N_3} OB, connect DC, and measure DC = N_4, so Xiao Ming can calculate A, B The distance between is ()",
