  "problem_text_cn": "如图,王红同学跳起来把一个排球打在离她3m远的地上,然后反弹碰到墙上,如果她跳起来击球时的高度是1.8m,排球落地点离墙的距离是6m,假设球一直沿直线运动,球能碰到墙面离地()米的地方．",
  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, Wang Hong jumped up and hit a volleyball on the ground N_0 away from her, and then bounced to hit the wall. If she jumped up and hit the ball at a height of N_1, the distance between the volleyball landing place and the wall was N_2, suppose The ball has been moving in a straight line, the ball can touch the wall () above the ground",
