  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, in order to measure the height of the oil surface in the oil barrel, insert a thin wooden stick from the small hole of the oil barrel and insert it into the barrel. The length of the insertion part AB of the stick is N_0, and the length of the oil part DB on the stick is N_1, the barrel height AC is N_2, then what is the height of the oil level CE in the barrel ()",
