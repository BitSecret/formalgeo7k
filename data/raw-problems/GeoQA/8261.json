  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, when planting trees on flat ground, the plant spacing (the horizontal distance between two adjacent trees) is required to be N_0. If trees are planted on a hilledge with a slope ratio of i = N_1:\\frac{N_2}{N_3}, and the plant spacing is also required to be N_4, then the slope distance between two adjacent trees is ()",
