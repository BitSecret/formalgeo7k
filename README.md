## Introduction
Formal mathematics plays an important role in mathematical research, especially with the deepening of mathematical research, the theory becomes obscure and difficult to understand, and computer aided verification is more needed. Geometry involves the literal description and image representation of knowledge, the unity of algebraic calculation and symbolic reasoning, so it is difficult to formalize.  
In addition, with the development of artificial intelligence, AI-assisted mathematics research has become a promising research direction. For the answers to the mathematical problems generated by AI, it is also necessary to design a reasoning machine for automatic verification.  
So we designed a plane geometry formalization system and provided a python implementation of this system, which we call FormalGeo. It can accept formalized problem description, infer the goal and output the problem solving process.  

## Function
1.Use formal language - geometric definition language (GDL) to configure the reasoner. Therefore, compared with the original version, the scalability and sharing are greatly improved.  
2.Use formal language - conditional declaration language (CDL) to input formalized geometric problems into the reasoner.  
3.Get a visible, traceable, and interpretable problem-solving process. We can easily check every step of geometric reasoning.  
4.Generate information about problem-solving process, such as solution hypertree, CDL of every step, Directed acyclic graph of applied theorem, etc. These interfaces provide verification information for correctness of problem-solving and facilitate AI-assisted reasoning.

`core` is the implementation code of the FormalGeo. The architecture of each module and the relationship between modules are shown in figure 1.  
`cowork` displays collaboration information.  
`data` contains unformalized but unified geometry problem datasets, such as Geometry3K, GeoQA, UniGeo, etc. It also contains formalized problems, which stores in *data/formalized-problems*.  
`doc` is the introduction of formal system and project-related documentation.
