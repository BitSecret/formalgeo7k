  "problem_text_en": "After the Wenchuan earthquake, the rescue team sent a helicopter to the two villages of A and B. The aircraft was at point P above the ground N_0. The measured depression angle of village A was N_1 and the depression angle of village B was N_2 (as shown in the figure). Then the distance between the two villages A and B is ().",

  "raw_answer": "解:∠A=30°,∠PBC=60°,∴∠APB=60°-30°,∴∠APB=∠A,∴AB=PB．在Rt△BCP中,∠C=90°,∠PBC=60°,PC=450米,所以PB=\\frac{450}{sin60{^°}}=\\frac{900}{√{3}}=300√{3}．所以AB=PB=300√{3}．故选:D．"
