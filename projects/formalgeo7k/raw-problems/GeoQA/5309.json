  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, steel balls are often used to measure the wide openings of small round holes on parts. Assuming that the diameter of the steel ball is N_0, the measured distance between the top of the steel ball and the surface of the part is N_1, as shown in the figure. Then the length of the wide mouth AB of this small round hole is ()",

  "raw_answer": "解:连接AB,OA,过点O作OD⊥AB于点D,∵钢珠的直径是10mm,钢珠顶端离零件表面的距离为8mm,∴OA=5mm,OD=8-5=3mm,∵OD⊥AB∴在Rt△OAD中,AD=√{OA²-OD²}=4mm,∴AB=2AD=8mm故选:C."
