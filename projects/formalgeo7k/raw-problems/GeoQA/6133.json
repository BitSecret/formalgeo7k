  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, a student tries to keep the hypotenuse of the triangular plate level by adjusting his position, and the edge DE is on the same straight line as the point B. It is known that the two edges DE = N_0, EF = N_1, and the measured edge DF is away from On the ground AC = N_2, CD = N_3, then the tree height is ().",
