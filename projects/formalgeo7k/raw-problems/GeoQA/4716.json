  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, two points A and B are located at both ends of a pond. Xiao Cong wants to use a rope to measure the distance between A and B, but the rope is not long enough. A classmate helped him think of an idea: first take one on the ground. Go directly to point C of A and B, find the midpoints D and E of AC and BC, and measure the length of DE as N_0, then the distance between A and B is () ",
