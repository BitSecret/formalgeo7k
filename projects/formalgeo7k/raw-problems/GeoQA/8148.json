  "problem_text_en": "At N_0 o'clock in the morning, a boat departs from point A and sails eastward at a speed of N_1 nautical miles per hour, and arrives at point B at N_2 o'clock and N_3 minutes (as shown in the figure). From the two points A and B, it is measured that the small island M is in the direction of N_4 east by north and N_5 east by north, then the distance between the ship and the small island M at B is ()",
