  "problem_text_cn": "某同学想利用影长测量学校旗杆的高度,如图,他在某一时刻立1米长的标杆测得其影长为1.2米,同时旗杆的投影一部分在地面上,另一部分在某一建筑的墙上,分别测得其长度为9.6米和2米,则学校旗杆的高度为()米．",
  "problem_text_en": "A student wants to use the shadow length to measure the height of the school flagpole. As shown in the figure, he set up a N_0-long benchmark at a certain moment and measured its shadow length as N_1. At the same time, part of the projection of the flagpole is on the ground and the other part is on the wall of a certain building. On the top, the lengths are measured as N_2 and N_3 respectively, then the height of the school flagpole is ().",

  "raw_answer": "解:1米长的标杆测得其影长为1.2米,即某一时刻实际高度和影长之比为定值\\frac{1}{1.2},\n所以墙上的2米投射到地面上实际为2.4米,即旗杆影长为12米,\n因此旗杆总高度为10米,\n故选:D．"
