  "problem_text_en": "The figure is a side view of a machine that transfers goods at a cargo station. AD ⊥ DB, the angle between the original conveyor belt AB and the ground DB is N_0. In order to shorten the distance of goods transmission, the worker wants to increase the angle between the conveyor belt and the ground, changing it from N_1 to N_2, and the original conveyor belt AB length is N_3. Then the length of the new conveyor belt AC is ()",
