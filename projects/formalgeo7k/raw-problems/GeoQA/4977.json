  "problem_text_en": "A tunnel needs to be opened in a certain place, and the length of tunnel AB cannot be directly measured. As shown in the figure, take a point C on the ground so that point C can directly reach the two points A and B. Measure the midpoints D and E between AC and BC. The measured length of DE is N_0, then the length of tunnel AB is ()",
