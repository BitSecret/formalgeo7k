  "problem_text_cn": "如图,比例规是一种画图工具,它由长度相等的两脚AD和BC交叉构成,利用它可以把线段按一定的比例伸长或缩短．如果把比例规的两脚合上,使螺丝钉固定在刻度4的地方(即同时使OA=4OD,OB=4OC),然后张开两脚,使A,B两个尖端分别在线段l的两个端点上,若CD=3,则AB的长是()",
  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, the scale gauge is a drawing tool. It is composed of two feet AD and BC of equal length intersecting. With it, the line segment can be extended or shortened in a certain proportion. If the two feet of the scale are closed, the screw is fixed at the scale N_0 (that is, OA = N_1 OD, OB = N_2 OC at the same time), and then open two feet so that the two tips of A and B are respectively on the two endpoints of line segment l, if CD = N_3, then the length of AB is ()",
