  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, it is a regular polygonal pattern composed of the same flower pots according to certain rules. Among them, the N_0 pattern has a total of N_1 flower pots, the N_2 pattern has a total of N_3 flower pots, and the N_4 pattern has a total of N_3 flower pots. There are N_5 flower pots, …then the number of flower pots in the N_6th figure is ()",
